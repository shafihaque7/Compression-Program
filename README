The program compresses files. It encodes and decodes the files.
My role was the encode and the priority queue. I did buildCode, dumpTree as well as appendCode with lots of help from the TA.
We each wrote 50 percent of the code.

How to Compile:
make encode
	Use the command make or make all
	or
make decode
make encode

How to Run:
	run ./encode and ./decode; both accept -i inputFile and -o outputFile and -v to turn on verbose
	-p prints out the tree.
	The program works perfectly.
